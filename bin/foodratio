=head1 NAME

foodratio - calculate ingredient ratios

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ cat recipe
  1 egg   wet
  2 water wet
  4 flour dry
  $ foodratio recipe
  $ foodratio --ratio id:flour
  $ foodratio --mass 55 --weigh group:wet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a list of measurements of ingredients, foodratio will calculate
the ratio between those various inputs, optionally using some ingredient
(or group of ingredients) as the ratio key. The weights can be
recalculated based on the measurement of a particular ingredient.

=head2 Options

=over 4

=item B<mass> I<positive-number>

Sets the mass for the B<weigh> method; ingredient measurements will be
recalculated based on this amount.

=item B<ratio> I<key:value>

Sets the ingredient or ingredient group to use as the key value for
the ratio calculation, e.g. flour in a bread recipe and not the
default total mass. I<key> must be C<id> or C<group>.

=item B<weigh> I<key:value>

Sets the ingredient or ingredient group to use as the basis for the
B<mass> argument, which by default is otherwise the totall mass.
